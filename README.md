#### Experimental Gameplay:
(Work in progress features that are only available when Experimental Gameplay is enabled in world settings)

    - To get a Structure Block, you must use the ‘/give’ command
    - When a structure is being loaded in, it can also be mirrored or rotated
    - Structure Void blocks can be placed in an area to not copy air into the target area
